Overview of the project

Project:  SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM



Objective


To develop a speech recognition system that accurately converts spoken language into text, enabling efficient interaction with devices and applications through voice commands, transcription, and language understanding.


Key Activities

•	Data Collection: Gather diverse audio datasets covering various languages, accents, and environments.
•	Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess audio (e.g., noise removal, feature extraction using MFCC or spectrograms).
•	Training: Train the model on labeled audio-text pairs to map speech to text. 
•	Integration: Implement the system in applications (e.g., virtual assistants, transcription tools).
•	Optimization: Improve performance for real-time recognition, noise robustness, and language adaptability.



Technology Used

• Audio Processing: Libraries like Librosa, PyDub, and FFmpeg for audio preprocessing and feature extraction.
•	Speech Models: Pre-trained models like DeepSpeech, Wav2Vec, or Whisper for efficient speech-to-text conversion.
•	APIs: Google Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, and Microsoft Azure Speech services for ready-to-use solutions.
•	Evaluation Tools: Metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) for assessing system accuracy.
